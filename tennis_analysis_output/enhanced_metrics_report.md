#### Deviations from Optimal Range:
- **Shoulder Rotation Angle**: The amateur's value (96.2) exceeds the optimal range (70-90)

### Swing Phase Analysis

- **Total Preparation to Impact Time**: Professional: 1.73s, Amateur: 1.47s
- **Backswing to Impact Time**: Professional: 1.07s, Amateur: 0.13s
  - The amateur's forward swing is significantly faster than the professional's, which may indicate rushing through the swing.

## Detailed Metrics Analysis

### Preparation

#### Shoulder Rotation Timing
*Track when player's shoulders rotate relative to ball position (using pose and ball tracking).*

**Optimal Range**: Before ball crosses player's service line
**Professional**: 1.47°
**Amateur**: 1.47°

**Analysis:**
Both players show similar values for this metric (difference: 0%).

#### Shoulder Rotation Angle
*Calculate angle between shoulders and net at peak backswing (using shoulder landmarks).*

**Optimal Range**: 70°–90° relative to net
**Professional**: 87.52°
**Amateur**: 96.18°

**Analysis:**
Both players show similar values for this metric (difference: 10%).

### Footwork & Balance

#### Center of Mass Stability
*Track horizontal and vertical shifts of hip landmarks (center of mass proxy) through stroke.*

**Optimal Range**: COM shift < 15–20 cm during stroke
**Professional**: 20.85 cm
**Amateur**: 43.64 cm

**Analysis:**
The amateur player's value is 109% higher than the professional's.

#### Knee Bend
*Measure knee joint angle (hip-knee-ankle) at preparation and contact frames.*

**Optimal Range**: Knee angle ~120°–140°
**Professional**: 146.25 cm
**Amateur**: 177.28 cm

**Analysis:**
The amateur player's value is 21% higher than the professional's.

### Swing Path

#### Vertical Wrist Displacement
*Calculate vertical displacement of wrist landmark from backswing to contact.*

**Optimal Range**: 35–50 cm vertical displacement
**Professional**: 29.00 cm
**Amateur**: 2.21 cm

**Analysis:**
The professional player's value is 92% higher than the amateur's.

### Contact Point & Timing

#### Contact Position Horizontal
*Determine ball-racket contact frame, measure relative position to player's front hip landmark.*

**Optimal Range**: Slightly in front of player's front hip
**Professional**: Not measured
**Amateur**: -0.13 cm

#### Contact Height
*Vertical position of ball-racket contact relative to waist height landmarks.*

**Optimal Range**: Waist height ± 10–15 cm
**Professional**: Not measured
**Amateur**: 0.16 cm

### Joint Angles & Biomechanics

#### Elbow Angle at Contact
*Calculate elbow angle (shoulder-elbow-wrist) at ball impact.*

**Optimal Range**: 130°–150°
**Professional**: 95.67°
**Amateur**: 124.27°

**Analysis:**
Neither player has values within the optimal range. Elbow too bent or too straight
The amateur player's value is 30% higher than the professional's.

#### Wrist Stability at Contact
*Measure wrist joint alignment at contact (angle between racket and forearm).*

**Optimal Range**: Near neutral (160°–180°)
**Professional**: 176.60 cm
**Amateur**: 178.07 cm

**Analysis:**
Both players show similar values for this metric (difference: 1%).

#### Hip Rotation
*Measure rotation angle of hips at contact relative to baseline.*

**Optimal Range**: 70°–90° rotation at contact
**Professional**: 116.47°
**Amateur**: 90.10°

**Analysis:**
The professional player's value is 23% higher than the amateur's.

### Follow-through

### Recovery

## Practical Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are specific drills and exercises to improve your forehand technique:

### 1. Improve Lower Body Stability and Knee Bend
- **Issue**: Your knee angle is too straight (measured at 177.3°)
- **Target**: Aim for knee angle between 120°-140° at impact
- **Exercise**: Practice drop step and split step with exaggerated knee bend
- **Drill**: Shadow swings focusing on holding a deeper knee bend throughout the stroke
- **Cue**: "Sit in a chair" feeling during preparation and impact

### 3. Develop Proper Swing Path
- **Issue**: Insufficient vertical wrist movement (too flat)
- **Target**: Increase vertical wrist displacement to 35-50cm
- **Exercise**: Shadow swings with exaggerated low-to-high path
- **Drill**: Ball drops with focus on brushing up the back of the ball
- **Cue**: "Swing from pocket to shoulder" to create proper swing arc

### 4. Complete Follow-Through
- **Issue**: While your follow-through distance is good, ensure it wraps around your body
- **Target**: Maintain follow-through with proper shoulder rotation
- **Exercise**: Shadow swings with full follow-through and freeze finish
- **Drill**: Hit with focus on follow-through position (racket ending over opposite shoulder)
- **Cue**: "Finish with racket by your left ear" (for right-handed player)

## Weekly Practice Plan

Integrate these focus areas into your training with this progressive practice plan:

### Week 1: Technical Foundation
- Monday: 20 minutes shadow swings focusing on preparation position and knee bend
- Wednesday: 30 minutes drop-feed practice focusing on swing path
- Friday: 20 minutes video review and shadow swing corrections

### Week 2: Integration
- Monday: 30 minutes cooperative rally focusing on one technical element at a time
- Wednesday: 30 minutes directional control with new technique
- Friday: 20 minutes high-repetition drill with coach feedback

### Week 3: Performance
- Monday: 30 minutes live ball drilling with defensive to offensive scenarios
- Wednesday: 30 minutes point play focusing on implementation
- Friday: 30 minutes video analysis and comparison to baseline

## Final Notes

The analysis provides valuable insights, but remember that technique is individual. Focus on progressive implementation of changes rather than trying to change everything at once.

Consult with your coach when implementing these recommendations to ensure they integrate well with your overall playing style and physical capabilities.
