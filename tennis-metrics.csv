Preparation,Shoulder Rotation Timing,Track when player's shoulders rotate relative to ball position (using pose and ball tracking).,Before ball crosses player's service line,Late preparation
Preparation,Shoulder Rotation Angle,Calculate angle between shoulders and net at peak backswing (using shoulder landmarks).,70°–90° relative to net,Insufficient shoulder rotation
Footwork & Balance,Center of Mass Stability,Track horizontal and vertical shifts of hip landmarks (center of mass proxy) through stroke.,COM shift < 15–20 cm during stroke,Poor balance and stability
Footwork & Balance,Knee Bend,Measure knee joint angle (hip-knee-ankle) at preparation and contact frames.,Knee angle ~120°–140°,Excessive or insufficient knee bend
Swing Path,Vertical Wrist Displacement,Calculate vertical displacement of wrist landmark from backswing to contact.,35–50 cm vertical displacement,Flat or incorrect swing path
Swing Path,Follow-through Length,Track distance wrist landmark travels after contact point horizontally and vertically.,Wrist extends beyond opposite shoulder level,Short or restricted follow-through
Contact Point & Timing,Contact Position Horizontal,"Determine ball-racket contact frame, measure relative position to player's front hip landmark.",Slightly in front of player's front hip,Late or early contact
Contact Point & Timing,Contact Height,Vertical position of ball-racket contact relative to waist height landmarks.,Waist height ± 10–15 cm,Incorrect contact height
Joint Angles & Biomechanics,Elbow Angle at Contact,Calculate elbow angle (shoulder-elbow-wrist) at ball impact.,130°–150°,Elbow too bent or too straight
Joint Angles & Biomechanics,Wrist Stability at Contact,Measure wrist joint alignment at contact (angle between racket and forearm).,Near neutral (160°–180°),Unstable wrist position
Joint Angles & Biomechanics,Hip Rotation,Measure rotation angle of hips at contact relative to baseline.,70°–90° rotation at contact,Insufficient hip rotation
Follow-through,Post-Contact Shoulder & Hip Rotation,Measure additional shoulder/hip rotation after contact point.,80°–110° rotation,Incomplete body rotation
Recovery,Return to Neutral Stance Time,Time from end of stroke to achieving neutral stance (use foot landmarks).,< 1–2 seconds after stroke completion,Slow recovery
